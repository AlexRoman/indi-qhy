Temporary home for INDI (http://indilib.org) drivers for QHY astronomical cameras.

Nothing quite works yet :-) but the QHY9 support (which I own) is almost there.
I plan to add support for the other documented cameras (and the existing QHY5 driver)
in the near future and submit to INDI upstream.


QHY9 Current Status
-------------------

What works:

- getting images at bin 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 works. At least I think they do,
  I've only shot darks :-)
- temperature control works by using libusb_bulk_transfer to the interrupt EPs instead
  of libusb_interrupt_transfer as per example libqhyccd. The regulator itself is crappy
  (oscillates), but will do for first light.
- CFW control

What doesn't work:

- controlling the shutter to shoot darks (why?! this seemed to work earlier)
- subframes
- all sorts of various options like download speed, etc are missing
- error checking
