Temporary home for INDI (http://indilib.org) drivers for QHY astronomical cameras.

Nothing quite works yet :-) but the QHY9 support (which I own) is almost there.
I plan to add support for the other documented cameras (and the existing QHY5 driver)
in the near future and submit to INDI upstream.


QHY9 Current Status
-------------------

- downloading images at bin 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 works, subframes don't
- CFW control isn't working yet
- controlling the shutter to shoot darks is not working (any more?! it seemed to work)
- temperature control works by using libusb_bulk_transfer to the interrupt EPs instead
  of libusb_interrupt_transfer. No idea why or what this means.
